# AI Tech Due Diligence Agent

This project is an autonomous AI agent designed to review software projects
and help identify technical risks, code quality issues, and overall readiness.

The goal is to simulate a basic tech due diligence process that is usually
performed by engineering teams, and automate it using AI agents.

## What it does
- Analyzes a codebase (structure, patterns, basic risks)
- Highlights potential technical red flags
- Produces a simple technical risk summary
- Outputs a Go / No-Go style recommendation

## Why it matters
Technical due diligence is time-consuming and expensive.
This project explores how AI agents can assist founders, investors,
and technical teams by speeding up early-stage technical reviews.

## Status
Work in progress – MVP under development
